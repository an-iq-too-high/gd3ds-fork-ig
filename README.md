# FAQ
### How do I install this on my 3DS?
The current easiest way is to open the Universal Updater app on your 3DS and download the game from there. If you prefer doing it manually, download either the .3dsx or .cia file from the releases page and place it on your SD Card, then depending on which file you chose, launch it through the Homebrew Launcher, or install it to your home menu through FBI.

### The game is saying something about "missing DSP firmware", what do I do?
If you're playing on actual hardware this shouldn't be an issue as most 3DS homebrew tutorials dump this file in the process. If you're playing on an emulator, navigate to ```(your emulator's data folder)\sdmc\3ds\``` and create a file named ```dspfirm.cdc``` in said location. It can be completely empty for all the emulator cares, it just has to be present. In case you're running into this error on a real console, open the Luma menu (usually accessed by pressing ``L``, ``DPAD DOWN`` and ``SELECT`` at the same time), scroll to ``Miscellaneous options...`` and press ``Dump DSP firmware``.

### How do I play / add custom levels?
You'll need to either export a copy of your level of choice using the [GDShare Geode mod](https://geode-sdk.org/mods/hjfod.gdshare) or download an archive of said level from [GDHistory](https://history.geometrydash.eu/). If the level uses a custom song, you'll also need to either extract it from your Geometry Dash songs folder (```%localappdata%\GeometryDash``` on Windows), or download it separately from [Newgrounds](https://www.newgrounds.com/audio). Once you have the level .gmd (and song, renamed to its Newgrounds ID) prepared, copy them to ```\3ds\gd3ds\external_levels\``` and ```\3ds\gd3ds\saved_songs\``` on your SD Card respectively. Putting the level files into additional folders within the main ```\external_levels\``` directory is supported. Do keep in mind, however, that any objects from updates 2.0 and above will not load, and object-heavy levels are not guaranteed to be playable - especially on non-New 3DS models.

### Are you going to add a level editor?
no. 

### Can you add X feature / X gamemode / X level?
Everything that's planned to be implemented is listed in the planned features section above - in short, anything major from updates above 1.9 will not be added. However, if you come up with an improvement or a quality of life feature the game could use, you're welcome to suggest it in the Discord server.

### Why not add 2.0 / 2.1 / 2.2 / whatever?
no.
